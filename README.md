# Welcome to Github Session

Welcome **Git Explorers!**

In this session you will have familiarity on "How to Git".. unfortunately this will not cover everything but will give us the ability to plan with git and github it will help us perform the same actions we need to do in git.soma or any other github organization and collaborations.

While we will discuss and play with github.com, we will not cover all the options that github may have enabled.
Having said that, this repo does have some requirements that will get it close to real life experience, for example, you **cannot** merge commits to main branch.

## What you need to know before...

Before we dive into this interactive session, we have few technical prerequisite.
1. You need git installed on your local machine, you can verify it by opening `terminal` app and typing `git --version`.
	If by any chance you got an error or never worked with git you can google on how install it, for developers with MacBooks it should be included in your Xcode tools for mac.
2. Another resource for this session is the [test-container](https://github.com/idog1980/test_container). to run it, you need to have 2 more technical prerequisites , python3 installed and docker (instructions can be found in the test-container repo)

# About this simple website
This simple website is a website for the team.
The purpose of this exercise with the time we have left is to enhance the team website with information, committing, pushed and merging while using the test-container in order to advance.

## So.. What NOT to do?
All of our IDE's like Intellij and VS code has git integration.
For the sake of this session do not use it, open the Terminal and work by hand.  

## So.. What to do?

In order for this workshop to succeed please think incremental changes , add code in very small steps.. it will allow us to collaborate more.
Think also about how we can link code with each other , and changing each other code (small changes) to show how can we work together.

Examples for additional content:
 - A personal page with a bit info about you
 - List of tasks in this release 
 - Connection with other team mates (link your page to theirs and back)
 -  Pictures of family and friends
 - Recent vacations
 - Food and restaurants recommendations
 - Technology and hobbies page.

 
Since this is not an HTML workshop, please feel free to use any code generation you would like. like chatGPT or github co-pilot.


**Thats it ... Happy Gitting...**
